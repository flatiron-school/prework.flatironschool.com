# iOS Development
This list comes from keeping track of what has been useful and not useful from
the past few years of learning iOS on my own. I'm compiling this to be a sort
of reference guide for the students in my upcoming class at [The Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/iOScurriculum.html "Flatiron School iOS Curriculum").

This is meant to get you up to speed with development from no prior iOS
experience. None of this covers the basics of computing/development though. 

Students learn in a plethora of ways. If you are an auditory learner there is 
also a ton of great video content from
[Stanford](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/coding-together-developing/id593208016
"Stanford iTunes U Link") but the progression is pretty obvious so I didn't create a guide for
that. I HIGHLY recommend the Stanford class.

There is an infinite amount of stuff to learn on iOS. This is a list of what
I've found to be the most important for almost every app out there. A secondary
goal of this prework is to limit the scope of learning before you get started.
There really is nothing better than just writing a ton of code. Hopefully this
list of resources can get you to writing code quickly.

## Structure

This guide is separated out into the different big topics of iOS development.
I am including advanced topics here mostly for completeness and for reference
down the line. 

If you currently know very little, start with the beginner section and do
all the topics. This should get you up to speed with iOS development and really
I would just start writing code! Don't start looking into the advanced topics
until you find a topic you *need* to learn.

The Advanced and Referece/Library sections are for you to use once your feel
comfortable with your skills. I really recommend completing all the beginner 
materials before moving on to the advanced resources though. Once you look into
developing apps that require the topics you can return here and find out more
information and hopefully some links to start your research with.

Also, each section contains a description of an example app you should be able
to make. Feel free to try and make the app with the skills you have. If you
have issues with making the app, raise an issue. Hopefully someone will help
you out :)

Last, the Learning Objectives are what I expect you to understand after reading
the beginner materials. Remember the advanced materials are just for deep dives
into topics!

### Flatiron School Students

Flatiron School Students, your job is to go through each section until the
Advanced iOS work. The Advanced iOS section at the end is if you
are really interested and want to keep learning, but isn't required. Don't
worry about the reference or library items. These are all things we will
discuss and use in class. If you already have prior knowledge feel free to skip sections you
feel comfortable with. The best way to learn is through writing a lot of code.
While the ToDo list app I mention isn't required, I'd *highly* recommend trying
to write it.

## Setup

I tried to use as many free resources as possible but ultimately you have to
spend some money. You'll need to purchase [Learning iOS Development: A Hands-on
Guide to the Fundamentals of iOS Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-iOS-Development-Hands--Fundamentals/dp/0321862961/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1387385220&sr=8-1&keywords=learning+ios+development)
 for a few of the items in this guide. It's an incredible book and it has been
updated for iOS 7/Xcode 5.

## Thoughts

###Breadth of Familiarity
This list of resources will not make you an expert by any means. The goal for
this guide is breadth of knowledge over depth in any one topic. If you are
particularly interested in a topic, feel free to check out the advanced
resources and reference material. 

The best way to learn this stuff is still to just write a ton of code. In
addition to checking out the advanced material on a certain topic, coding up
the example apps is a great way to get a deeper understanding.

###Minimum Viable Knowledge
Learning the topics in the order given allows you to start writing apps as soon
as possible. That's the fun stuff, so I didn't want you to have to read for
hours before getting your hands dirty. The goal is layers of quality. After the
first section you will be able to write simple apps. Every new topic you learn
will give you real skills to enhance your app. This means that if you are
struggling with one topic it may be prudent to stay in that one topic and learn
more. If you find other resources that helped you learn please raise and issue
and I'll include it.

## Getting Help

If you are confused on a topic, I doubt you're alone. 

Thankfully, there are a few resources available to you.
The easiest is using the [iOS section on
StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ios "StackOverflow iOS
tagged homepage"). If the question is about a certain resource here, or about
this guide in general please please please raise an issue on github. I'll look
into it and hopefully give you a solution that everyone can use.

## Credits

First, we'd love to thank all the amazing people who created these source
materials. Most of it is from [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) and
[Pearson](http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Learning-iOS-Development-A-Handson-Guide-to-the-Fundamentals-of-iOS-Programming/9780321862969.page).
Obviously there are a lot more resources out there for learning these topics.
This guide is just my current preferences and tries to put them in a linear
fashion so skills can build upon each other. Hope it helps someone. Oh and the
theme for the site was purchased from
[WrapBootstrap](https://wrapbootstrap.com/).
