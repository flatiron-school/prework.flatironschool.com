            <h1>Web Development</h1>

<p>The first version of the prework we tried to assemble all of the best resources
for learning to build a web application in Rails. With our students, we noticed
that the pre-work wasn&#39;t preparing them as well as it could have. We were
missing a big opportunity. Our students expressed that the pre-work went for
breadth over depth. Rather than honing in on ruby, the meat of our curriculum,
a lot of time was spent on HTML and CSS which is an important but secondary
piece.</p>

<p>We strongly belive that learning should have context, and you should know what
your goals are.  Each section will address which learning objectives it will
cover, and at the beginning we expect all of you to check out the Ruby
assesment so you know what you&#39;ll be expected to do at the end.  There&#39;s an
infinite amount of things you could spend your time learning, part of the value
of the prework is that we can narrow the scope to only the most essential.  If
you can achieve fluency in the following topics we believe you&#39;ll flourish at
the Flatiron School.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>To complete these units, you will need a <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>
and
<a href="http://www.codeschool.com/enrollments/dnFtaXFMbXROSVVqT3N1bngwWnBRUjhGc2k1Z1dEOW52cFJvZEMzRUZvRT0tLWpvUElMODBvdFhiZlA4MjE2Mlc2c1E9PQ==">CodeSchool</a>
account. They
are each normally $25 a month, so figure you might spend $50-$100 depending on
how quickly you get through the material. So far the fine folks at
<a href="http://www.codeschool.com/enrollments/dnFtaXFMbXROSVVqT3N1bngwWnBRUjhGc2k1Z1dEOW52cFJvZEMzRUZvRT0tLWpvUElMODBvdFhiZlA4MjE2Mlc2c1E9PQ==">CodeSchool</a>
have created a $9 trial month for all Flatiron Preworkers. Register using that
link. Treehouse will offer something similar soon. You also will need a
<a href="http://codeacademy.com/">CodeAcademy</a> account which is free.</p>

<p>You should also have a Rails Development environment setup. There are lots of
guides for that on the internet and depending on your OS and setup, it&#39;s a bit
of a process. You could always use the cross-platform <a href="http://installrails.com/">Install Rails</a>.</p>

<p>Note to students accepted into the Flatiron School. We will provide you with an
account to treehouse and codeschool, feel free to use your own to get started,
but we cover those costs for the duration of the prework and semester.</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>One of the challenges in learning how to code is that you probably don&#39;t even
know what you&#39;re supposed to learn. When creating this prework, we had 4 goals
in mind.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Full Stack</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;ll present the full stack of technologies required to build a webapp from
the ground up. We don&#39;t care if you use ERB or HAML. The web is built on HTML
and everyone should learn it. Whether NoSQL or RDBMS, understanding the
fundamentals of schema design and SQL is crucial. Students shouldn&#39;t shy away
from depth. How can you be a web developer without a proficiency in these
skills?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Linear Progression</strong></p>

<p>The material is presented in order, going from web basics and computer
basics, to markup, to styling, to version control, to programming, and then
to databases and web frameworks. You learn the basics of code through Ruby
and then finally move to Rails that builds upon the rest. Thus you start at
the lowest level, the literal HTML the browser renders, and progress up
through levels of abstraction until you finally get to the kitchen sink that
is the Rails framework. As a beginner, don&#39;t try to learn Rails without
knowing basic HTML/CSS and ruby. It&#39;s a disservice to your education.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Curated Resources</strong></p>

<p>There is such a plethora of amazing content on learning to code. We liked the
consistency of going to a few sources that all shared common interfaces and
learning patterns, like videos and interactive portions. So this isn&#39;t a
complete list of all the resources, but more a curated list of what we think
works well together (with lots of feedback from alumni). We would love it if
you submitted a github issue with more materials you&#39;ve enjoyed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Language Agnosticism</strong></p>

<p>In the end, programming is about abstractions and expressions. The mechanics
of code are universal and exist in all modern languages, like python, ruby,
and javascript. We teach Ruby because we love it. Thinking your language
choice, especially as a beginner, matters, is like thinking that you can only
write poetry in English and not in Spanish. Obviously the beauty of poetry is
in rhyme and meter, in metaphor and simile, in cadence and rhythm, not in the
king&#39;s English. Why should code be any different? At Flatiron, you&#39;re
learning how to think, how to break problems down, how to express yourself,
how to abstract ideas, and how to work together. We just learn that through
Ruby.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>The goal of this tutorial is to be able to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be comfortable navigating your development environment</li>
<li>Understand where programming skills fit into the &quot;web&quot;</li>
<li>Understand what pieces make up a web application</li>
<li>Develop a level of comfort with the most common ruby patterns in web development</li>
<li>Understand the basics of version control and why it is used</li>
<li>Have a basic understanding of HTML including forms</li>
<li>Through Rails you should learn the following:

<ul>
<li>RESTful interfaces</li>
<li>HTTP</li>
<li>Routing</li>
<li>Where ruby fits in the web development stack</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Develop a comfort with basic SQL queries</li>
<li>Have a basic understanding of an ORM, ActiveRecord</li>
<li>Develop a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Command Line</h2>

<p><em>Min 2hr Max 6hr</em></p>

<p>The command line is your home base. It&#39;s probably one of the most important
differences between a consumer of a computer, and a user. Many developers have
all sorts of crazy short cut keys set up so that they can use their computer
solely from the command line without ever having to reach for the mouse. It&#39;s
vitaly important that you start thinking like a developer, rather than a
consumer. Getting comfortable with the command line is the first step. If you
feel like you&#39;re spending too much time on this section, and you&#39;ve
accomplished the learning objectives, move on.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Navigate a file structure</li>
<li>Use your terminal to type commands</li>
<li>Make files and directories from the command line</li>
<li>Open files from the command line</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations-2" title="Console Foundation Treehouse Link">Console Foundations</a> is a great video series by Treehouse that
covers lots of Bash Stuff. Some of it is more advanced, so we only included a
few sections we feel are crucial. But feel free to skip around. The stuff about
Environment Variables and PATHS is important. But it&#39;s short and worth going
through at least once.</p>

<h4>WAT?</h4>

<p>What is version control?!</p>

<p>from Github&#39;s &quot;About Version Control&quot; Version control is a system that records
changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific
versions later. Even though the examples in this book show software source code
as the files under version control, in reality any type of file on a computer
can be placed under version control.</p>

<h1>Programming</h1>

<h2>Ruby</h2>

<p><em>Min 20Hr Max 40Hr</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>My conscience won’t let me call Ruby a computer language. That would imply
that the language works primarily on the computer’s terms. That the language
is designed to accomodate the computer, first and foremost. That therefore,
we, the coders, are foreigners, seeking citizenship in the computer’s
locale. It’s the computer’s language and we are translators for the world.</p>

<p>But what do you call the language when your brain begins to think in that
language? When you start to use the language’s own words and colloquialisms
to express yourself. Say, the computer can’t do that. How can it be the
computer’s language? It is ours, we speak it natively!</p>

<p>We can no longer truthfully call it a computer language. It is coderspeak.
It is the language of our thoughts.</p>

<p><a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/">_why&#39;s poignant guide to ruby</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Programming allows you to automate common, repetitive tasks on the computer.
Developers use programming languages to write software, the software you
interact with every day. From your alarm clock to your computer; from the web to
the satellites orbiting our planet, software powers all of it.</p>

<p>Ruby is a programming language that we can use to do any task that needs to be
automated. For example, something that is really irritating is a cluttered
&quot;Downloads&quot; folder on your Mac. We could write a program that moves a file to a
new folder, based on it&#39;s file extension, whenever we download something. A
&quot;scripting-language&quot; would be best suited for this task.</p>

<p>Ruby is one of the most popular languages to create web applications. A web
framework is a tool that makes developing for the web relatively simple. The
most popular web frameworks for Ruby are Sinatra and Ruby on Rails. All of
these languages and web frameworks are considered server side languages as they
will be run on an actual web server.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/ruby-foundations">http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/ruby-foundations</a></p>

<p>The Treehouse Ruby series is a great beginner resource. It&#39;s a bit slower
paced, so feel free to move faster if you got through the CodeAcademy unit
easily.</p>

<h3><a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">Learn to Program</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/</a></p>

<p>Chris Pine&#39;s Learn to Program is a classic book that is mostly available online
for free. Read it all. Then buy it and read it again. By the point in the 
  prework, the fundementals of Ruby should be pretty clear. Pine&#39;s book is also 
  available at: <a href="http://it-ebooks.info/book/36/">http://it-ebooks.info/book/36/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits">http://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits</a></p>

<p>Learn all the little bits that make Ruby one of the most popular programming
languages amongst non-programmers and programmers alike.</p>

<h1>Web Development</h1>

<p>There are many mediums, through which one can deliver applications. You can
have Desktop Applications, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system">Embedded Applications</a> and Web Applications to name a
few. At Flatiron School we focus on building Web Applications.</p>

<p>In a previous section you built a static website using HTML and CSS. You used
markup languages to tell the browser how to render the content you were
displaying. In order to have the ability to interact with your users and store
the information they give you, we&#39;ll need to add more technologies to our
toolbelt. These technologies are usually referred to as your &quot;Stack.&quot;</p>

<p>A stack usually includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Operating System: a collection of software that manages computer hardware
resources and provides common services for computer programs e.g. <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a></li>
<li>Web Server: Software that helps deliver web content to a client e.g.
<a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">nginx</a></li>
<li>Database: An organized collection of data. <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for example.</li>
<li>Programming Language, like <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a></li>
<li>A Web Framework like <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;ve already covered the basics of your operating system and done a brief
intro to Ruby. Now we will do a short intro to the language that is used by
most of the databases we will be using, SQL.</p>

<h2>SQL &amp; Databases</h2>

<p><em>Min 4hr Max 10hr</em></p>

<p>In order for a web application to be useful it needs to store data, access that
data and organize the data. This is the job of a database. Typically web apps
respond to user input and do one of four things, create, read, update, or
delete data in a database. Ruby serves as a kind of intermediary between the
user and the database and Ruby can communicate with a database in its native
language, which for our purposes is SQL.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Understand what a database is used for</li>
<li>Be able to create, read, update and delete data</li>
<li>Understand how you can relate two tables in a database (ex. products and categories)</li>
<li>Be able to write a simple SQL join between two tables</li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/database-foundations">Treehouse SQL Course</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/database-foundations">http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/database-foundations</a></p>

<p>The Treehouse SQL course is comprehensive and easy to follow. It uses MySQL,
which is a powerful database server that we don&#39;t really use at Flatiron for
teaching purposes, but learning how to install it and use its GUI isn&#39;t a waste
of time. So feel free to gloss over the MySQL setup / specific stuff, but it&#39;s
useful.</p>

<h3><a href="http://zetcode.com/db/sqlite/">ZetCode SQL Course</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://zetcode.com/db/sqlite/">http://zetcode.com/db/sqlite/</a></p>

<p>A more technical introduction to SQL through SQLite3 and the Terminal. It&#39;s
short and intense, but try to get through the entire thing. A nice bonus is if
you want to start playing with SQLite and Ruby, go through the other <a href="http://zetcode.com/db/sqliteruby/">Zetcode
SQLite and Ruby</a> tutorial.</p>

<h2>Rails</h2>

<p><em>Min 8hr Max 16hr</em></p>

<p>To build a Rails application you&#39;ll need to be able to save and retrieve data
from a database using SQL, send HTML and CSS back to the browser, navigate your
computer using the command line, and use git to version control your source
code. Because Rails requires so many skills at once, we don&#39;t want the focus of
the prework to be Rails, but rather getting introduced to the concepts
necessary to build modern web applications. Hopefully the first time we talk
about Rails in the classroom, it won&#39;t be the first time you&#39;ve heard the terms
controller or route, but it&#39;s also not the goal to master Rails before you get
here. With that in mind, feel free to spend as much time as you&#39;d like
exploring Rails through the following tutorials. However, we&#39;re going to cover
all of this in depth during the semester so it&#39;s probably best to use these
turorials as a guide for the component skills you&#39;ll need to build web
applications. For example, how much Ruby do I need to know? Can be answered by
building a Rails application and seeing how much Ruby you need to know.</p>

<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

<ol>
<li>Understand how to create a basic data model</li>
<li>Posting data from a web form to create new objects in the database</li>
<li>Controllers</li>
<li>Routes and URLs</li>
<li>The Params Object</li>
<li>Gathering data from a database, sending the data from the controller to the view</li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Getting Started with Rails Guide</a></h3>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>First, we&#39;d love to thank all the amazing people who created these source
materials. Most of it is from CodeSchool and Treehouse, with a bit from Zed
Shaw, and some from the people at Skillcrush. Obviously there are a lot more
resources out there for learning these topics. This guide is just my current
preferences and tries to put them in a linear fashion so skills can build upon
each other. Hope it helps someone. Oh and the theme for the site was purchased
from <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">WrapBootstrap</a>.</p>
