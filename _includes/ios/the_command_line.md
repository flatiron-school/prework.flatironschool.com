## The Command Line 
*Min 2hr Max 6hr*

The command line is your home base. It's probably one of the most important
differences between a consumer of a computer, and a user. Many developers have
all sorts of crazy short cut keys set up so that they can use their computer
solely from the command line without ever having to reach for the mouse. It's
vitally important that you start thinking like a developer, rather than a
consumer. Getting comfortable with the command line is the first step. If you
feel like you're spending too much time on this section, and you've
accomplished the learning objectives, move on.
