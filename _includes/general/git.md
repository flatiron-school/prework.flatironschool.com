#### WAT?
What is version control?!

Github's "About Version Control" Version control is a system that records
changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific
versions later. Even though the examples in this book show software source code
as the files under version control, in reality any type of file on a computer
can be placed under version control.
